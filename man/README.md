Man Pages for x52pro-linux
==========================

This folder contains the man pages for the components of libx52 in a Markdown
format called ronn. To convert them into man pages requires the ronn executable,
which may be found in the ruby-ronn package on Ubuntu. Other distributions may
have a similar package name.

ronn may also be found at http://github.com/rtomayko/ronn
