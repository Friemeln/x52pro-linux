The X52 pro is a HOTAS (hand on throttle and stick)\r\nwith 7 axes, 39 buttons, 1 hat and 1 thumbstick and a multi-function\r\ndisplay which is programmable.\r\n\r\nCurrently, only Windows drivers are available from Saitek PLC, which\r\nled me to develop a new Linux driver which can program the MFD and\r\nthe individual LEDs on the joystick. Although the standard usbhid\r\ndriver is capable of reading the joystick, it is not sufficient to\r\nreally utilize all the capabilities of this system.\r\n\r\nThis project is currently a work-in-progress. However a high level\r\noutline of the current objectives are listed below:\r\n\r\n* Write a kernel module and export sysfs interfaces to act as a\r\ndriver.\r\n* Write a userspace program that can configure the kernel module\r\nand create custom button mappings to keyboard or mouse events.\r\n* Add interrupt handling and export a /dev/input/jsX interface.\r\n* Allow userspace programs to register callbacks on MFD button events.","google":""}
