Kernel driver for Saitek X52 Pro
================================

This folder contains a loadable kernel module for the Saitek X52Pro HOTAS.
Note that the standard usbhid driver already supports this joystick as an
input device, and the additional functionality of the LEDs and MFD can be
handled by a userspace library.

**This module is only a proof-of-concept and not suitable for production**
